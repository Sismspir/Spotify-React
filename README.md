# Spotify-React

This application utilizes the Spotify Web API to conduct artist searches and showcase their most popular tracks. When a user inputs the name of an artist into the search bar, the application sends a request to the Spotify API to obtain a list of matching artists. It then retrieves the top tracks for each artist and presents them on the page. Additionally, users have the ability to choose a song and include it in their personal list of favorite tracks. Material-UI is employed to exhibit a dropdown menu of songs within the application.
