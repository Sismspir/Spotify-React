# Spotify-React

The app uses Spotify Web API to search for artists and display their top tracks. When a user types in the name of an artist in the search bar, 
the app makes a request to the Spotify API to retrieve a list of matching artists. It then retrieves the top tracks for each artist and displays 
them on the page. The app also allows users to select a song and add it to their list of favorite songs. The app uses Material-UI to display a dropdown menu of songs.
